# *Interpreted Language*
## Runs the a program line by line and execute each command, this programming language is cross-platform which makes it faster or easier to test and debug, the source code is public because you need to send to everyone that wants to run the program.

# *Compiled Language*
## Compiled language are converted directly into machine code that the processor can execute, once it's compiled is ready to run, is often faster since it might be optimized for an specific OS or CPU, the source code is private and is not multi-platform and it needs a compiler to debug the program.

# *Is Java compiled or interpreted, or both?* 
## Is a hybrid programming language


# *Pseudocode currency converter*
# You have been selected to develop the algorithm that will be used to convert dollars (USD) to bitcoin (BTC), for this the first thing you must do is deliver a pseudocode with the algorithm to be developed, in this way you can explain in a better way to the team what will be the required operation. The main idea is to have a website where the user will be asked to enter the amount to convert.

1. START
2. BTC <-- 0.000022
3. USD <-- 0.00
